# Mycelium Icon Design Concepts

## Design Principles

Based on requirements 1.1 and 3.2, the icon must:
- Incorporate mycelium/fungal network visual metaphors
- Balance organic curves with technical precision
- Use a 24x24 unit grid system for geometric precision
- Convey security, reliability, and sophistication

## Concept Explorations

### Concept 01: Basic Network
- **Approach**: Central hub with four radiating branches
- **Strengths**: Clear, simple, scalable
- **Weaknesses**: Perhaps too generic, could be any network
- **Grid Usage**: Proper 24x24 alignment, 2-unit stroke weights

### Concept 02: Organic Mesh
- **Approach**: Clustered central nodes with organic connections
- **Strengths**: More organic feel, represents mycelium growth patterns
- **Weaknesses**: May be too complex at small sizes
- **Grid Usage**: Maintains grid alignment while allowing organic curves

### Concept 03: Geometric Network
- **Approach**: Hexagonal structure with precise geometric branches
- **Strengths**: Technical precision, strong geometric foundation
- **Weaknesses**: May feel too rigid, less organic
- **Grid Usage**: Perfect grid alignment, mathematical precision

### Concept 04: Branching Tree
- **Approach**: Tree-like structure with interconnecting threads
- **Strengths**: Natural growth metaphor, clear hierarchy
- **Weaknesses**: More tree-like than mycelium-like
- **Grid Usage**: Good grid usage, organic branching within structure

## Technical Specifications

All concepts follow:
- 24x24 unit grid system
- 2-unit stroke weights for primary elements
- 1-unit stroke weights for secondary connections
- Consistent corner radius approach
- Scalability considerations from 16px to 1000px

## Next Steps

The geometric network (Concept 03) appears to best balance:
1. Technical precision required for security tool branding
2. Mycelium network metaphor
3. Scalability requirements
4. Professional aesthetic

This concept will be refined into the final vector artwork in task 2.2.
